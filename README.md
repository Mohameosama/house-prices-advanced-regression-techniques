# Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and other attributes. The dataset is derived from a real estate dataset, containing 81 features about the houses.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict house prices. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** The dataset contains 1460 rows and 81 columns.
- **Key Features:**
  - `MSSubClass`: The type of dwelling.
  - `LotFrontage`: Linear feet of street connected to the property.
  - `YearBuilt`: The year the house was built.
  - `SalePrice`: The target variable, representing the price of the house.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize or scale numerical data as needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize distributions and relationships between features.
   - Understand key drivers of house prices.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create or modify features to enhance model performance.
   - Perform feature selection to reduce dimensionality.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, etc.).
   - Optimize hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Measure model performance using metrics like RMSE or MAE.
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted prices.
